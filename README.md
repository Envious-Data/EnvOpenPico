# EnvOpenPico
A RP2040 Based family of MCU boards

### Intentions
The intentions of this project were mainly to learn about MCU design and also to make a rpi pico like device using a RP2040 that has some improvements or changes that you'd find useful, so far Ive changed the type-c port and added a reset button as well as replaced the buck boost IC with a linear regulator.

### Important!!
I have only had the EnvOpenPico made so the other variants like the PicoLipo and the EliteMicro2040 I cant fully confirm if the design works but since its all derived from the main project I should hope it all works as intended.

### Notes
- You should be able to order these and have them entirely assembled by JLCPCB if they have stock of all the parts, ive made sure to label everything in the schematic properly.
- Please ensure you pick a compatible flash chip, you may need to modify the connections to the flash chip, its setup for Winbond W25QxxJVxxx.
