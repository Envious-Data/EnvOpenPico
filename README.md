# EnvOpenPico
A RP2040 Based family of MCU boards

### Intentions

I orginally planed to make a RPI Pico clone with some personal improvements however Ive currently done that, I'd now like to make a few variations namely a DIP40 compatible version, and a full pinout version since the pi pico its self has a couple of un-used GPIOs.


### Notes
- You should be able to order these and have them entirely assembled by JLCPCB if they have stock
- should be compatible with the rpi pico firmware as its rather board agnostic (the dip40-32a version will not be)


### Versions
- EnvOpenPico - This is the standard Raspberry Pi Pico clone that I've Made
- Dip40-RP2040 - This is a dip40 sized rp2040 board as this was a complaint I saw about the rpi pico.
- Dip40-RP2040-32A - This is another Dip40 rp2400 board but its meant to be pinout compatible with an Atmel ATmega32A.
