# EnvOpenPico
A Raspberry Pi Pico Clone which also uses the RP2040.

### Info
I originally made this as I wanted to replace my raspberry pi pico with a version that had Type-C because I didnt like how the Micro Type-B ports on mine were wearing out already.

### some notes
I dont update the readme very often so some info here may end up outdated at some point


### results
Batch 1 - Accidentally ordered TPS63002 instead of TPS63001
Batch 2 - flashchip GD25Q40 appears to be incompatible but the board boots up and presents bootloader usb
Batch 3 - Yet to order

#### I do plan to get the buck boost swapped and the flash chip swapped on batch 1/2.
